### Fork

Forking means creating a new repository with the same code and changes (like a rough copy) in another personâ€™s GitHub to make your own changes (usually for open source).

* Whatever commits and changes we make will be done in **our GitHub only**.
* To merge this with the **main person** who has the code, we again need to create a **Pull Request (PR)**.
