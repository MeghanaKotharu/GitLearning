## Local to Git & Github(Intial)

When we create a new repo/folder in a local machine instead of GitHub we need to follow a little different process.
Done only once to upload from local to GitHub & Git.

* If we already have a previous project aligned we need to remove that origin from our git. 
* We should make sure to mention the branch(rename to main) also initially when pushing to github


* Add the local directory/repo into Git using **add & commit** files.(Make sure you are inside the directory/repo)
* Create an empty directory with the same name in GitHub and **donâ€™t initialize README** (if we do, then we need to do that in local also).

| Command                        | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git init`                     | Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.                             |
| `git remote add origin <link>` | Adds the repo into GitHub (link will be the newly created repo in GitHub).             |
| `git remote -v`                | To check remote repo info (the repo name we got is where we will push our files next). |
|`git remote remove origin`      | Removes any existing origin already linked.                                            |
|`git branch -M <new-name>`      | Renames your current branch.(used to rename master to main, if we are in master)       |
| `git pull origin main --rebase`         | If README.md is intialised in your github, not in local and you are trying to push changes from local to git -this will ensure the readme is retracted into local, after this run git push|
| `git push origin main --force`         | To force push your local files to Githyb(remote) -Whatever already present in github might be erased(when readme is present in local, we can use this instead of the above command) |

After this we will do push into GitHub.
