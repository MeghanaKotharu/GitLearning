# Forks in GitHub

- A **Fork** creates a copy of someone else’s repository **under your GitHub account**.  
- Useful for **open-source contribution**.  

Workflow:  
1. Fork a repo → copy it to your GitHub.  
2. Make changes in your fork.  
3. Create a **Pull Request (PR)** to suggest merging your changes back into the original repository.
