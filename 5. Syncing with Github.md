## Syncing with Github

Commands for collaborating and pushing/pulling changes to GitHub or another remote host.


If we already have a previous project aligned we need to remove that origin from our git. 

| Command                                | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git push origin <branch-name>` (main) | Upload your local commits to the remote repository.                              |
| `git push -u origin main`              | We can simply write `git push` and all the changes will be added from next time. |
|`git remote remove origin`      | Removes any existing origin already linked.                                              |
|`git remote add upstream https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git`      | If we want to keep both the repoâ€™s (existing one and add a new one)                                          |
| `git fetch origin`                     | Downloads changes from the remote without merging them into your local branch.   |
| `git pull origin <branch-name>`        | Downloads and automatically merges changes from the remote.                      |
| `git remote add origin <link>`         | Links your local repository to a remote one on GitHub.                           |
