## Local to Git

Now all the code we got from GitHub is in our local system but not stored to Git (use the `status` command).
So to save them use the below commands.

For Git we should do both **add** and **commit** commands, but for GitHub only **commit** is enough.

| Command                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `git status`                   | Shows the current state of your working directory (untracked, modified, staged files). <br> **Untracked (U)** – New files that are created in VSCode that are not yet added to Git. <br> **Modified (M)** – Changes made in Git. <br> **Staged (S)** – Changes that are added to Git but not yet committed. <br> **Unmodified** – Committed to Git. <br> If changes in local not saved to Git it shows → *your branch is ahead by 1 commit*. |
| `git add <file>`               | Stages a specific file for the next commit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
