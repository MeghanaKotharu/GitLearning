# 7. Undoing & Rewriting History

Commands for correcting mistakes. **Use with caution**, as some of these can permanently delete history.

### Case 1: Staged Changes (added but not yet committed)

* `git reset`
* We need to add and commit old version to Git again as we rolled back.

### Case 2: Committed Changes

* For one commit: `git reset HEAD~1`
  *(Like Linked List it stores values and we are moving the pointer back).*
* For many commits: `git reset <commit-hash>` (use `git log` to get hash number).

| Command                            | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git reset <file-name>` (optional) | Unstages a file, but keeps the changes in your working directory. <br> **Note**: If we donâ€™t give file name it will reset all the file changes made. |
| `git reset HEAD~1`                 | Undoes the last commit, but keeps the changes unstaged in your working directory.                                                                    |
| `git log`                          | Used to see log history and commit hash.                                                                                                             |
| `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`   | All the changes made above are in Git only, so if we want these to reflect in VS Code use this.                                                      |
| `git revert <commit-hash>`         | Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a specific commit.                                                                                   |
| `git stash`                        | Temporarily saves your uncommitted changes to work on something else.                                                                                |
| `git stash pop`                    | Applies the last saved stash and removes it from the stash list.                                                                                     |
