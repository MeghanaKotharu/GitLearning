## Branching & Merging

Commands for creating and managing separate lines of development.

### Branching

There are multiple branches as multiple teams working on different copies create their own copies called as branch.

* Initially **master** used to be the default branch, but later GitHub changed their policies due to the term sounding controversial and made **main** the default branch.
* We can create a new branch named `main` and push our changes, or just rename the existing `master` branch name and make it into `main`.
* (Main motto is to push changes into the default branch).
* **Master** and **main** are two different branches.

```bash
git branch -M main   # to rename branch, "main" is the new name
```

### Merging

There are two ways of merging:

1. **Using the git merge & diff commands in terminal**
2. **Using Pull Request (PR) in GitHub directly**

   * Select **Pull Request (PR)** in GitHub and then select **Compare and Pull Request**
   * It shows the 2 branches that it is going to merge
   * Creates a new PR
   * Checks if it can automatically be done without conflicts
   * Confirm merge
